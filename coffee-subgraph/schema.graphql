# Mutability comes at a price, and for entity types for 
# which it is known that they will never be modified, 
# for example, because they simply contain data extracted 
# verbatim from the chain, it is recommended to mark them 
# as immutable with @entity(immutable: true)
# Queries on immutable data is much faster than queries on mutable data.

# Each entity must have an id field, which must be of type Bytes! or String!
# ! means field is mandatory
# Int has a size of 32 bytes
# BigInt is for large numbers.  Used for Ethereums uint32 and larger.
# Bytes is a byte array as a hexadecimal string. Commonly used for 
#   Eth hashes and addresses
# String is a scalar for string values.  Null characters are not supported.
# Boolean 

# custom scalar: date 
#   YYYY-MM-DD ex: 2000-12-19

# @derivedFrom(field: "fieldInOtherEntity") performs a reverse lookup.
# This is more performant than storing arrays for each "many" relationship.
# ex: 
#   payments: [Payment!] @derivedFrom(field: "workerPaid") #in Worker entity.
#   workerPaid: Worker! #in Payment entity
# 
#   A query for 'payments' of a worker instead queries the "workerPaid" field 
#   in all Payment entities.  The query returns all the Payment entities who
#   have that worker in their "workerPaid" field.
